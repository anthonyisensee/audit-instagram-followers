# Audit Your Instagram Followers (and Following)

The script.js file in this repository will walk you through the process of programtically identifying Instagram users that you follow and that don't follow you back (a.k.a. people that are no longer invested in knowing what's going on in your life) or users that follow you and that you don't follow back (a.k.a. people that you stopped following and forgot to remove as a follower, or that you kept around for followers clout).

Note that the latter identification can help keep private accounts truly secure, as users you unfollowed may still be able to see your posts unless you remove them manually as followers.

For me, this is just a way to ensure that `users_i_follow.length == users_that_folow_me.length` and that I'm equally invested in the life events of the people that are as invested in mine.

I also may have just had too much free time on my hands today.
